## dotprofiles
Clean and minimalistic dotprofiles for zsh, bash and vim.
- zprofile/zshrc is intended for macOS.
- bash\_profile/bashrc is tested on RHEL 8.
- vimrc should work fine for Ansible/yaml and Python coding.

Shell profiles provides:
- colorization
- prompt with git branch
- shell completions
- [homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew) and [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) added to path (for zsh)
- some handy aliases +++
